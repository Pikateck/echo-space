# Bargained Price Consistency Fix üéØ

## üîç **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: The bargained price shown in the modal (‚Çπ30,00,000) was not matching the price displayed on the booking/reservation pages.

**Root Cause**: The system was treating the bargained price as a "per-night rate" and then applying additional taxes and fees through the `calculateTotalPrice` function, instead of treating it as the final all-inclusive amount that the user agreed to.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed Price Calculation Logic**

**Before**:

```typescript
const roomPrice = bargainedPrice || selectedRoom.totalPrice;
const totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(
  roomPrice,
  checkIn,
  checkOut,
  rooms,
  currency,
);
// This was adding 14% tax + 5% fees on top of bargained price!
```

**After**:

```typescript
const totalPrice = isBargained
  ? {
      // Treat bargained price as final total amount
      totalPrice: bargainedPrice!,
      taxes: 0, // Already included
      fees: 0, // Already included
      // ... other fields
    }
  : calculateTotalPrice(roomPrice, checkIn, checkOut, rooms, currency);
```

### 2. **Updated Data Flow**

**Enhanced URL Parameter Passing**:

- ReservationPage ‚Üí BookingVoucher: Now passes `totalPrice`, `roomPrice`, `bargained`, `currency`
- BookingVoucher ‚Üí BookingInvoice: Uses actual booking data instead of hardcoded values
- Consistent pricing throughout the entire flow

### 3. **Fixed Price Display Components**

**BookingVoucher.tsx**:

- Now uses actual `totalPrice` from URL parameters
- Calculates correct savings for bargained bookings
- Shows proper payment status (Paid for bargained, Pending for regular)

**BookingInvoice.tsx**:

- Uses actual pricing data instead of sample data
- Shows correct payment method (Credit Card for bargained, Pay at Hotel for regular)
- Displays accurate totals with zero additional taxes/fees for bargained bookings

### 4. **Enhanced Savings Calculation**

**Fixed Formula**:

```typescript
// Before: selectedRoom.totalPrice - roomPrice (incorrect)
// After: (selectedRoom.totalPrice * totalNights) - totalPrice.totalPrice (correct)
```

**Result**: Now correctly compares total amounts instead of mixing per-night vs total pricing.
